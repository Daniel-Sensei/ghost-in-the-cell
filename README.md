## Introduction
Ghost in the Cell is a project developed for the Artificial Intelligence course. It is a game that combines strategic gameplay with the implementation of an artificial intelligence module based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). The graphical part of the game was developed using Java's Swing libraries.

## Game Rules
The game is set in a world composed of a grid of cells, where players control cyborg factories. The goal is to conquer as many factories as possible, defeating opponents and balancing cyborg production for defense and attack.

## Technologies Used
The project makes use of various technologies, including:
- **Answer Set Programming (ASP)**: Used to implement the artificial intelligence module that makes strategic decisions for players.
- **Java Swing**: Used for the development of the game's graphical interface.
- **EmbASP**: Java library for integrating ASP into Java projects.
- **DLV2**: ASP system used for executing ASP programs.

## Starting the Project
To start the project, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub.
3. Import the project into a compatible Java IDE.
4. Add the two encodings in the "encodings" folder
5. Compile and run the project.
